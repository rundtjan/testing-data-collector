# The Testing Data Collector

A rust server that collects stats sent to it via post requests to /stats. In the shape "description_in_one_word 234234". Where the number might be, e.g., milliseconds from testing the speed of code somewhere.

Either use natively with cargo build and cargo run or fire up a docker container using the Dockerfile. It will be fun.
